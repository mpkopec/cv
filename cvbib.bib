abstract = {In this work, a novel reconfigurable Dose-3D detector intended for a full spatial therapeutic dose measurement to improve radiotherapy treatment planning is presented. The device is composed of a reconfigurable detection phantom allowing patient-centric adjustments to its geometry, a scalable data acquisition system (including hardware, firmware, and low-level software) designed to change with the phantom’s configuration seamlessly, and a high-level software package for tumour geometry extraction based on computer tomography scans. Extracted geometry will be used in the Monte Carlo simulations and the configuration of the phantom. Each of the components to be used in the measurement system has been assessed obtaining the following results. The scintillating voxels’ light output is sufficient. The data acquisition system with its hardware and software has been tested using artificial testing signals and laser light proving a reliable and robust means of physics data reconstruction.}

The preliminary results, discussed here, pertain to the intelligent medical data augmentation using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) technique implemented inside MONAI framework. However, in the scope of the project, we perform a broad search for the most efficient and advanced Deep Learning (DL) models to create tools for 3D Computed Tomography (CT) images segmentation and cancer diagnosis improvement that will be an integral part of the custom designed software platform for processing data collected with Dose-3D phantom. Apart from the innovative detection system the software itself may prove to be disruptive in the context of the currently available tools by offering open-source high quality toolkit for wide use in everyday clinical applications.}
